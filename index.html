      <h3>Project 2: Structural Design of Information <small>Due March 31</small></h3>
      <p>
        In stark contrast to the first project, which emphasizes visual display of information,
        Project 2 looks at the structural/semantic design of information that can be easily
        retrieved and shared across different devices and platforms. Working from a data set similar
        to that of your first project, you will create a structural information design either as a
        series of XML or JSON files, or as a relational database (e.g., MySQL).
      </p>
      <p>
        A central concern of this project will be <i>granularity</i>: you will need a structural
        representation of the list of all of the records that make up your dataset (at least one
        XML or JSON file) and a structural representation of each record itself (one XML/JSON file
        per record, most likely).
      </p>
      <p>
        You will also need to come up with some sort of metadata scheme to categorize and/or tag the
        records that make up your set. This may come in the form of XML attributes, special XML
        tags, or specific JSON properties and language features (especially arrays).
      </p>
      <h4>Deliverables &amp; Milestones</h4>
      <ol class="deliverables">
        <li>
          A proposal memo (about a paragraph or two) emailed to the instructor by 9am on Monday,
          March 3
        </li>
        <li>
          A shared Dropbox link to all deliverables
        </li>
        <li>
          An HTML or PDF document that shows your in-progress work and briefly discusses your design
          process and thinking over the course of the project
        </li>
        <li>
          A series of XML or JSON files (if you wish to do a relational database, we will need to
          discuss how to submit that work): one file providing a listing of all records that is
          then somehow keyed (e.g., through a unique identifier) to the individual records (one
          record per file, unless another schema presents itself that makes better sense for your
          particular dataset)
        </li>
        <li>

      <h3>Project 4 (COM541 Only): Information Architecture &amp; Professionalization <small>Due April 14</small></h3>
      <p>
        For this project, you will look at the professional work of information architects and the
        kinds of professionalization activities expected of them. You will then convey this
        information in a compelling, Web-friendly visual design with brief, accompanying text that
        aims to recruit students to become information architects. Full description to be posted by
        March 24.

    <div class="extended">
      <h3>Project 1: Visual Design of Information <small>Due February 17</small></h3>
      <p>
        Project 1 asks you to take some set of data and build from it a static information display
        that both aids in your audience’s understanding of the information and makes a particular
        visual argument for how the audience should act based on their understanding. Your design
        should strive for a high degree of information density: like the examples throughout Tufte’s
        <em>Envisioning Information</em>, a high-density information display does not necessarily
        derive from extraordinarily dense data. Instead, density emerges from juxtaposition of one
        simple set of data with another; from small multiples of simple data spread out over
        time/space; or in combining two strategies for information display into one (a
        photo-realistic map of terrain with an otherwise simplified map of train lines).
      </p>
      <p>
        You will submit two versions of your final design, both as PNG images: one for large-screen
        display (e.g., flat-screen televisions) and one for smaller, tablet-sized screen display.
        Paradoxically, the smaller display will likely have a higher level of detail than the
        large-screen display, given the distance at which someone would view the design. But the
        more important deliverable is a document that showcases the development of your idea: the
        emphasis on this assignment is the attempt you make at creating a dense information display,
        not just the final deliverables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your designs should not be some lame, boring Excel-produced pie charts. They should tell a
        story and make an argument, and be compelling enough that someone might want a poster of the
        design to hang on the wall (even if your designs aren’t quite wall-ready by the end of the
        project). They should make the audience you’re reaching stop and look more closely, at both
        the micro and macro levels of the design, much like in Tufte’s rich collection of examples.

        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
          COM541: Information Structure and Retrieval/HUM380: Dense Information, Distracted Humans
          looks at the use of information to help people gain insight and make decisions in the
          context of information overload. Drawing on theories from rhetoric, information
          architecture, and a range of other humanities disciplines (from history and philosophy to
          ethics), this course provides students with an applied-theoretical foundation in creating
          visual, structural, and interactive representations of information for retrieval across a
          range of electronic devices, particularly mobile technologies.

          <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Because technology is an essential part digital communication and information design, it
            is essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
            technologies (particularly an image-editing program of your choice) as for any other
            course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being
            unprepared for class.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
            it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
            provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to
            meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to
            contact me via email or GChat, or our Campfire room, well in advance of project
            deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
            up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
            is <em>expected</em> that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort
            is more important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the
            night before a project is due.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
          <p>
            Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the
            class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must
            miss, please contact me ahead of time via email.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
          <p>
            As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the Code of Academic Honesty as
            described in the
            <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml">IIT Student Handbook</a>).
            All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital
            page design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use
            of open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited
            as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
            dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
            source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
            part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
            the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
            violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
            a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of
            Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
            violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In
            order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the
            Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in
            IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744
            or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
          </p>
          <p>
            Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
            ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email,
            at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
            or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
            students.
